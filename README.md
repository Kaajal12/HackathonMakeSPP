Hackathon GoGreen Group Project

Overview: Premier High School Hackathon Virtual 3 Days

Purpose: My team and I created a website named GoGreen, for the environmental category in which were able to educate many about preserving the environment.

Features: Our website features a navigation bar and several pages including: Home, Sustainable Energy, Greener Living, Are Your Habits Eco-Friendly (Quiz), View 
Cool Facts, & a Sources Page. By providing multiple resources for living a greener lifestyle, users can play a quiz in which they can find out how 
eco-friendly they are in their community. In the end of the quiz, the user's will recieve a result that determines how eco-friendly they are.

Note: Website made using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript in Glitch.
